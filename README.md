Installation is simple. There are two ways to do so:

1. If you have the DF Starter Pack or any other pack using PyLNP, put the folders into the Mods subfolder of the pack. They can then be enabled and disabled willy nilly.

2. Merge the raw folder from the given minimod into the raw subfolder. This makes it slightly harder to uninstall, but should work just as well.
